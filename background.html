            <p>Hello! I am currently on my final year of undergraduate study in University of Waterloo, Canada. 
               I have been studying in Yunnan, China until finishing elementary school, then moved to Chiangmai, 
               Thailand to complete middle school and high school. 
               At the point of university, I decided to come to Canada.</p><br>
            <p>Moving from a place that is year-round 25Â°C to where it snows 6 months a year was quite fascinating. 
               I do hate the weather sometimes, but I do not regret coming here. 
               I believe exploring new things, seeing and feeling them, is essential to living life.</p><br>
            <p>Love cycling, art craft, modeling, and LEGO!</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Focus of Study</h1>
            <p>I study Biology on a molecular scale. I am interested in how Biology can cross-link with other disciplines, 
               such as computing. My focus of study is Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.</p><br>
            <p>I have been focusing on the molecular level, looking into genomics =)</p>
